This is the flag for selecting tight muons. There should only be tight muons in the samples you are using but it's worth setting up right now. 
mu_isTight == 1 (for tight muons)
mu_isTight == 0 (for loose muons)

Hi Keanu,

Zoom link for meeting:

I've attached the last set of slides I presented at the group meeting. If you look in the backup you will see the cutflows for mc16a.
I was using the samples in /data/atlas/HighMassDrellYan/test_mc16a to make these plots. 
You might see some difference in the diboson samples (I think this is up to date but there was an issue with some tags which I corrected) - if you spot any differences I will remake the cutflows and we can compare. 

Thanks,
Jesal
