This is the flag for selecting tight muons. There should only be tight muons in the samples you are using but it's worth setting up right now. 
mu_isTight == 1 (for tight muons)
mu_isTight == 0 (for loose muons)

Hi Keanu,

Zoom link for meeting:

I've attached the last set of slides I presented at the group meeting. If you look in the backup you will see the cutflows for mc16a.
I was using the samples in /data/atlas/HighMassDrellYan/test_mc16a to make these plots. 
You might see some difference in the diboson samples (I think this is up to date but there was an issue with some tags which I corrected) - if you spot any differences I will remake the cutflows and we can compare. 

Thanks,
Jesal

 I've attached the section about luminosity weighting and here are some screenshots of how I do this in my code.

finalWeight is what I used to scale each of my histograms to the correct lumi.

-The get the sum of weights you need to access information in the sum of weights tree.
-I added a screenshot of all the scale factors but you only need to use weight_leptonSF as this variable conveniently already is the sum of the other scale factors.

Also just to be extra clear, the variables names you use:
SF = weight_leptonSF;
kFactor = weight_KFactor;
pileup = weight_pileup;
mc_weight = weight_mc;
lumi_sample = lumi_data * cross_section (cross section of each sample so for each mass slice or the peak sample)
